## About

This project is dedicated to my personal website.
I've decided to have a "mono" repository
where the backend part *(Django)* is located in the `src` subfolder
and the frontend *(without any JS framework yet)* - in the `src_front` subfolder.

I shared the code in December 2023 and at that time
it contained the copy of my "static" version of the site (from 2019)
plus the Resume app that I have written to learn basics of Django Framework.

So, having it in public I can easily demonstrate my skills (or lack of them üòÉ)
and my progress on learning web development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Python 3.12+  
- Poetry 1.7+  
- Node.js 14+  
- Docker or PostgreSQL 16 server

## üíª Installation

If you want to run this website locally,
first you need to get the source code.

```plain
git clone https://github.com/hotenov/hotenov.com.git
cd hotenov.com
```

Second, build common static files.

### Build static files

```plain
npm install
npm run build
```

### Run local debug server

(without Docker)

1) Specify your PostgreSQL database credentials in `_DockerStuff/.env.dev.local`
(all `SQL_*` environment variables)

2) Install dependencies  

    ```plain
    poetry install
    ```

3) Activate your virtual environment

    ```plain
    poetry shell
    ```

4) Run Django debug server

    ```plain
    python src/manage.py runserver 8887
    ```

If you have Docker installed on your machine,
you can spin up two containers: debug server and PostgreSQL server.  
*(However, you still need to build static files outside Docker.
I plan to add a separate service for that someday)*

### Run DEV container

*(optional)* You can edit `_DockerStuff/.env.boilerplate`
and change debug server port via `WEB_PORT` variable (default is `8833`)

Execute the following command:  
*(If you are on Linux host, add `sudo` at the beginning)*

```plain
docker compose -f _DockerStuff/docker-compose.yml up
```

## üôèüèª Credits

The Resume app was inspired by [wagtail-resume](https://github.com/adinhodovic/wagtail-resume)
plug-in (by [Adin Hodovic](https://github.com/adinhodovic)).

I borrowed CSS layout for resume from [Coding Market](https://www.youtube.com/@CodingMarket)'s
YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9Yn20h2Jxw)
and a few styles from another [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnjHCmaUVPg)
by [Online Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/@OnlineTutorialsYT) channel.

I integrated a couple of web components from [codyhouse.co](https://codyhouse.co/)
owned by Amber Creative S.R.L.

[GitHub Profile Card](https://github.com/piotrl/github-profile-card) by [Piotr Lewandowski](https://github.com/piotrl)

The initial "static" website was based on [Clean Blog](https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-clean-blog) blog theme,
created by [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/).

Many JS and CSS snippets from the Internet *(see attribution in comments to the code)*.
